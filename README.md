# ðŸ§© HTML Serializer

A foundational tool for parsing and querying HTML using C#.  
This project implements two main components:
- **Html Serializer** â€“ parses raw HTML into a structured object tree.
- **Html Query** â€“ supports CSS-like querying over the object tree.

This infrastructure can later be extended into a full-fledged **Crawler**, **Scraper**, or **HTML Analyzer**.
